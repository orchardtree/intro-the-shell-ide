# Intro to the Shell

The Shell is the program on your computer that takes in commands you type and takes action based on those commands. It is foundational for any programmer. Among other things, it's how you'll tell the computer what to do with the code you write. 

You may sometimes hear the shell referred to as your "command line" or "terminal" or "console". There are some subtle differences between each of those terms, but by and large you can think of these as referring to ways of interacting with the Shell. 

The video below describes what the "native" shell (by which we mean the one that comes with the computer) looks like on Mac OS X.

As you start making progress on Learn, you'll start out by using the shell in the Learn IDE itself which acts the same as a "native" shell, except it's running against a server we've configured for you. More on that soon.

Next, you'll learn more abou the basic commands you'll use in the shell. Get love your shell, it's crucial for any programmer—it's your workbench!
