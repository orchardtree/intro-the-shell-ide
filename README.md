# Introduction to the Shell

## Problem Statement

Developers use their computers differently than you might have in the past. By
deciding to take this course, you're saying "I want to do that, too!" People
using their computers to code or write HTML "talk" to their computer through a
_terminal_ that runs a program called a _shell_. The terminal might be new to
you, so this lab is going to give you a tour.

The terminal might feel clunky at first compared with Windows or MacOSX. As you
learn more, though, it might start to grow on you!

## Learning Objectives

1. Define what a terminal program is
2. Recognize a shell program
3. Recognize operating systems providing a terminal
4. Explain confusing terms used when talking about the shell

## Define What a Terminal Program Is

A terminal program is a program that runs _another_ program, called a "shell."

Computers used to be more expensive than _houses_. Most businesses couldn't
afford for everyone to have their own computer. In order to share the computer,
people had small machines with screens with keyboards called "terminals." These
terminals would be connected to the computer by a long cable.  Terminals did
_not_ have mice or a local hard drive.

Here's an picture of a terminal.

Workers in those days would go to their terminal and do work on the big giant
machine in a far-off, well-cooled room.

In the 80's and 90's _personal_ computers became affordable. Companies like
Apple, IBM and HP put computers on everyone's desk. The terminals were
tossed.  But the _old_ computers the terminals used to talk to _still_ had 
good data in them. In order to talk to those computers, developers created 
programs called "_terminal emulators_." _Emulate_ means "mimic" or "copy".  
A _terminal emulator_ let them use the information stored on the old, shared 
computers in the new personal ones.


**"Terminal emulator" software mimics using a real-world terminal**. People
usually say "terminal" instead of "terminal emulator." So now you know what a
terminal program is, let's see a few!

### Specific Terminal Programs

Flatiron School's Learn IDE has a terminal:

The terminal is very important for Flatiron learners. When you open the IDE,
the terminal will be auto-opened.

MacOSX ships with a terminal program called `Terminal` located in
`Applications` &rarr; `Utilities` &rarr; `Terminal`. It looks like this:

There are a number of terminal programs for every operating system. They all do
the same thing. They give you a _shell_ in which to work. We'll talk about
shells in the next section!

> **NOTE**: We will use `Terminal` to refer to the MacOSX program called
> `Terminal`. Lower-case `terminal` is short for `terminal emulator` and refers
> to any program that allows you to talk to a computer through a screen and
> keyboard.

## Recognize a Shell Program

When you launch any of the _terminal_ programs, a _shell_ program is
launched with it.

The shell is the program on your computer that reads commands you type in and
takes action based on those commands. The shell will take your command and work
with the computer's operating system to try to answer your request. It will
return the result of that request to your table.

The shell behaves like a waiter. You can give it a command like "get ONE
CHEESEBURGER; MEDIUM." It will go to the kitchen, work with the cook and bring
back what you requested. You can tell the shell "delete `carlton_dance.gif` from
my Desktop" and it will!

### Recognizing the Command Prompt of the Shell

When you see a shell, it will be displaying a **command prompt**. This means, from the
computer's perspective "I'm listening..." It's like when our waiter pulls out
their notepad and pencil and asks if they can take your order.  Prompts may
look different from computer to computer. Don't let that confuse you. We've
seen weather reports, beautiful colors, and bitcoin trading prices in prompts.
At heart, though, they all ask: "What can I do for you?"

> **NOTE:** In many technical web pages, books, and sites  you'll see `$` to
> show a prompt. It's a tradition dating back to the 1960's.

You can ask the computer to do many types of tasks: show what's inside a file,
check to see if the site `www.flatironschool.com` is available, run a program
you wrote, etc. Just like learning to order at a restaurant, you'll have to
learn some phrases that the shell understands, but we'll lead you through that
process slowly.

Here's an example showing us working with the shell. You might see a
pattern here: prompt, run, result. Prompt, run, result. Over and over.

## Recognize Operating Systems Providing a Terminal

All operating systems provide a terminal! Time has shown that a terminal is a
valuable ally!

## Explain Confusing Terms Used When Talking About The Shell

You may sometimes hear the shell referred to as your "command line" or
"terminal" or "console". There are some subtle differences between each of
those terms, but by and large you can think of these as referring to ways of
working with the _shell_ via a _terminal_ program.

## Conclusion

A shell is a another way for you to work with your computer.  It's a different
style than the mouse- or touch-based styles you may have used before.  It is
the workhorse of technical authors and software developers.  Terminal programs
are present on all major operating systems.
